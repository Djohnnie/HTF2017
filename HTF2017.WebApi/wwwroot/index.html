            <h2>Anonymous Androids</h2>

        <p>
            We are 2030 and the world has reverted into chaos.
            766 million of the poorest people are roaming the planet with no home and in search of a better life.
            Because it is hard to infiltrate or hack their complicated communication
            and voting network without them knowing, another way of infiltration was devised.
            A large number of highly advanced androids, indistinguishable from actual humans,
            are being released onto the general public as we speak.
            These androids will anonymously collect data that we should process to anticipate any
            unexpected events or attacks against the established order.

        <p>
            Browse to <a href="https://seppevanwinkel.be/hackthefuture">the HTF2017 .NET challenge
                dashboard</a> to create your team and get started!
        </p>
        <p>
            Technically, this challenge is about communicating with an HTTP webservice using .NET code and
            writing your own HTTP webservice using ASP.NET WebAPI. You need to write .NET client code to
            call an existing HTTP webservice (written using ASP.NET WebAPI) to issue commands. You need to
            write .NET server code using ASP.NET WebAPI to receive feedback from the server.
            Additionaly you need to work on a dashboard in a UI technology of your choice.
        </p>

        <h2 id="androids">Androids</h2>
        <p>
            Your job is to deploy androids and create a dashboard to follow-up on their actions and findings.
            Each team has access to 1.000 of our newest and most advanced androids. Their workings are simple,
            but they can give you a lot of information about our threats.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are <b>three kinds</b> of androids:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Level 1</b><br />
                    These high-level androids are completely autonomous and decide by themselves if it is safe to
                    send you their sensory data. They have a very low chance of being detected of infiltrating and
                    are therefore very reliable. Their sensor updates are automated but not very frequent based on
                    the increased security risk. Sending manual requests is not supported!
                    The sensory data is low in frequency and usefullness, but the android is likely to last a long
                    time in the field gathering some useful data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Level 2</b><br />
                    These medium-level androids are partially autonomous and decide by themselves if it is safe to
                    send you their sensory data. You have the option to request a sensor update with the risk of
                    the android getting detected. Their sensor updates are automated just like the high-level androids.
                    The sensory data is low in frequency and medium in usefullness. The android is likely to get
                    detected if you request some sensor data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Level 3</b><br />
                    These low-level androids are partially autonomous but never decide to send you their sensory
                    data. You need to request updates with the risk of the android getting detected.
                    The sensory data is high in usefullness. The android is very likely to get detected if you
                    request some sensor data.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 id="sensors">Sensors</h2>
        <p>
            Each android has a limited number of sensors that can provide you with useful data.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Location</b><br />
                Returns the location based on longitude and lattitude. If the sensor is off, no location is
                measured. Depending on the sensor accuracy the location accuracy has a 1km fault radius for high accuracy,
                a 100km fault radius for medium accuracy and a 1000km fault radius for low accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Crowd</b><br />
                Returns the size of a crowd based on number of people. If the sensor is off, no crowding is
                measured. Depending on the sensor accuracy the crowding accuracy has a deviation of 100 people for
                high accuracy, 1K people for medium accuracy and 10K people for low accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mood</b><br />
                Returns the mood of a crowd based on an 8-bit number where a low number describes a relaxed mood
                and a high number describes a tense mood. If the sensor is off, no mood is measured.
                Depending on the sensor accuracy the mood accuracy has a deviation of 16 for high accuracy,
                64 for medium accuracy and 128 for low accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Relationship</b><br />
                Returns the relations between people of a crowd as an 8-bit number where a low number indicates
                no relations between people and a high number indicates strong relations between people. If the
                sensor is off, no relationship is measured. Depending on the sensor accuracy the relationship
                accuracy has a deviation of 16 for high accuracy, 64 for medium accuracy and 128 for low accuracy.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
        <p>
            If you are a competitive team, you can focus on the team scoring to have some fun while programming.
            Each action you take, but also its consequences can gain or lose you an amount of points.
            Below you can find a list of points to gain or lose. Have fun!
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>+100 points</b> for registering a new team.</li>
            <li><b>-1 points</b> for updating an existing team.</li>
            <li><b>+10 points</b> for deploying a level-1 android.</li>
            <li><b>+100 points</b> for deploying a level-2 android.</li>
            <li><b>+1000 points</b> for deploying a level-3 android.</li>
            <li><b>+10 points</b> for each successfully received feedback data.</li>
            <li><b>-1 points</b> for each unsuccessful received feedback data.</li>
            <li><b>-1000 points</b> for a each compromised level-1 android.</li>
            <li><b>-100 points</b> for a each compromised level-2 android.</li>
            <li><b>-10 points</b> for a each compromised level-3 android.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="swagger">Swagger</h2>
        <p>For this challenge</p>
        <p>Check out the <a href="/swagger">Swagger page</a> for the HTF2017 HTTP WebService</p>

        <h2 id="ngrok">ngrok</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> is an application for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux
            that creates a tunnel but also allows you to inspect all traffic that goes through the tunnel
            and replay that traffic for testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can <a href="https://ngrok.com/download">download</a> ngrok, unzip the package and run it
            from command-line or PowerShell.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make ngrok compatible with IISExpress (Visual Studio Debugging of ASP.NET web applications)
            you should add your ngrok hostname to the website bindings of the IISExpress configuration.
            For this you need to find the IISExpress icon in your Windows notification area, right click it
            and choose "Show all Applications". In this new window, you click your application and choose
            to edit the configuration in the bottom area of the window. In the configuration file you search
            for the &lt;bindings&gt; element and add the ngrok hostname to the bindings list to make ngrok work.
