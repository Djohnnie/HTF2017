        <p>
            We are 2030 and the world has reverted into chaos.
            766 million of the poorest people are roaming the planet with no home and in search for a better life.
            Because it is hard to infiltrate or hack their complicated communication
            and voting network without them knowing, another way of infiltration was devised.
            A large number of highly advanced androids, indistinguishable from actual humans,
            are being released onto the general public as we speak.
            These androids will anonymously collect data that we should process to anticipate any
            unexpected events or attacks against the established order.

        <h2>Androids</h2>
        <p>
            Your job is to deploy androids and create a dashboard to follow-up on their actions and findings.
            Each team has access to 1.000 of our newest and most advanced androids. Their workings are simple,
            but they can give you a lot of information about our threats.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are <b>three kinds</b> of androids:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Level 1</b><br />
                    These high-level androids are completely autonomous and decide by themselves if it is safe to
                    send you their sensory data. They have a very low chance of being detected of infiltrating and
                    are therefore very reliable. Their sensor updates are automated but not very frequent based on
                    the increased security risk.
                    The sensory data is low in frequency and usefullness, but the android is likely to last a long
                    time in the field gathering some usefull data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Level 2</b><br />
                    These medium-level androids are partially autonomous and decide by themselves if it is safe to
                    send you their sensory data. You have the option to request a sensor update with the risk of
                    the android getting detected. Their sensor updates are automated just like the high-level androids.
                    The sensory data is low in frequency and medium in usefullness. The android is likely to get
                    detected if you request some sensor data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Level 3</b><br />
                    These low-level androids are partially autonomous but never decide to send you their sensory
                    data. You need to request updates with the risk of the android getting detected.
                    The sensory data is high in usefullness. The android is very likely to get detected if you
                    request some sensor data.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
